**<h1>Setup step:</h1>**
1. Enter GITHUB folder
2. Download your prefered option:</br>
         - exe version : slower to open, but the whole program is inside a single file</br>
         - compressed version : extremely fast to open, but it will contain the exe version but with a folder containing the files it needs to work **_(RECOMMENDED)_**
3. Extract files or move the exe file where you want the program to live

NOTE: the program produces two extra files with it uses to store the data inputed, one database (for the save files name) and one binary file that just tells the program if you are a new user.
